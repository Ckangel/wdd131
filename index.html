I am a Ward Temple and Family History Leader, Ward Self Reliance group facilitator for Starting And Growing My Business course, Stake Communications Director, Executive Secretary to 2 Coordinating Councils - Accra East and Accra North, and serve with my wife as BYU Pathway Missionaries. I love classical and country music, driving and playing chess. I am a mushroom farmer too.</p>

          <p>Ghana's history dates back to at least 10,000 BCE. The country was named after a medieval trading empire that was located northwest of modern-day Ghana until the 13th century. In the 15th century, Ghana established direct sea trade with Europe, and the Portuguese, Dutch, and British built forts and castles along the coast to protect their trade interests. Ghana became the first sub-Saharan African country to gain independence from Britain in 1957.</p>
